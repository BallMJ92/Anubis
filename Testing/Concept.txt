Potential cryptographic quantum resistant algorithms for use in encryption/decryption within Anubis
*NTRU
*NewHope

Actors to display the functions of Anubis
*Alice (Sender)
*Bob (Receiver)
*Trent (Arbitrator)
*P (Plaintext)
*C (Ciphertext)
*E (Encrypt)
*D (Decrypt)

Example of how messages are sent and received on Anubis using RSA as an example
1 - Alice > Write message P > Select send to Bob > (P)^E=C > Send C to Bob
* C sent over network
2 - Bob > Receives C > C automatically decrypted > (C)^D=P > P displayed on Bobs messenger
3 - Bob > Write response P > Select send to Alice > (P)^E=C > Send C to Alice
* C sent over network
4 - Alice > Receives C > C automatically decrypted > (C)^D=P > P displayed on Alices messenger
