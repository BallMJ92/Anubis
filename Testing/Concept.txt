Potential cryptographic quantum resistant algorithms for use in encryption/decryption within Anubis
*NTRU
*NewHope

Hashing
*Sha512
*Salting

Dramatis Personae to display the functions of Anubis
*Alice (Participant)
*Bob (Participant)
*Trent (Trusted Arbitrator)
*Mallory (Malicious Attacker)
*Eve (Eavesdropper)
*P (Plaintext)
*C (Ciphertext)
*E (Encrypt)
*D (Decrypt)
*H (Hash)
*Salt (S)

Example of how messages are sent and received on Anubis using RSA as an example
1 - Alice > Write message P > Select send to Bob > (P)^E=C > Send C to Bob
* C sent over network
2 - Bob > Receives C > C automatically decrypted > (C)^D=P > P displayed on Bobs messenger
3 - Bob > Write response P > Select send to Alice > (P)^E=C > Send C to Alice
* C sent over network
4 - Alice > Receives C > C automatically decrypted > (C)^D=P > P displayed on Alices messenger

Example of how accounts are generated
1 - Alice > Select create new account > Enter username P > Enter password P twice > If passwords match password = P
2 - Hashing password P - H(P)=C > Salting C - S(C)=C > Store Username P alongside password C in database
3 - Alice selects login > Enter Username P > Enter password P > Hashing password P - H(P)=C > Salting C - S(C)=C
4 - If username P in database > if hashed+salted password C matches value in database connected to username P > Login successful
