**Abstract**

A theoretical quantum resistant peer-to-peer instant messenger utilising a suite of potential post quantum cryptographic algorithms, that makes it infeasable for an adversary with access to a sufficently powerful quantum computer to break.

**Encryption methods to maximise and ensure theoretical resistance to quantum based attacks**

* Password encryption (Hashing and salting methods):
Hash values utilise PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) to reduce vulnerability to brute force attacks, with a selected key to byte map of 64 and 100 encryption rounds to reduce preimage collision and vulnerability to Grover's algorithm<sup> 1</sup>. Although BCrypt is theortically not weakened by Grover's algorithm<sup> 2</sup>, this added layer of vulnerability reduction is simply a precaution. Salt values are generated randomly through BCrypt, utilising 20 rounds ensure a higher level entropy between generated salt values.
* Message encryption and verification (E2EE and signature methods):
Messages are encrypted asymmetrically end to end, with only the ciphertext sent through the clear. Quantum resistant public-key based cryptographic algorithms unrelated to integer factorisation and logarithmic problems will be used to ensure resistance to Shor's algorithm<sup> 3</sup> and Grover's algorithm. The public-key based algorithm used will either be based upon the the computational lattice problem<sup> 4</sup> or hardness of decoding a general linear code (McEliece cryptosystem)<sup> 5</sup>.
